Great! I’d be happy to help you make a new reservation at BBQ Nation. To get started, please share the following details:

1. Location – Which city would you like to book in? (e.g., Delhi or Bangalore)
2. Date – What date would you like to visit us?
3. Time – What time would you prefer for your reservation?
4. Number of Guests – How many people will be joining you?

You can provide these details one at a time or all together — whichever is easier for you.

Once I have this information, I’ll check availability and proceed with your booking!
